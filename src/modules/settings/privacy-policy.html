      <b>Disclosure of Personal Data</b>
      <p>
        In providing you with casual job employment, we may sometimes need to disclose your Personal Data to Employers

        unless we have your consent &/or are required to disclose your Personal Data as required in the normal course
        and scope of our business in the provision of our services to you, &/or for contractual, legal and regulatory
        requirements. Some examples of the types of external organisations we may need to disclose information to in the
        course of providing a product or service are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Regulatory bodies and agencies, eg Ministry of Manpower (MOM), Central Provident Fund Board Singapore (CPF)

          comply with our Privacy Policy and that of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (Act 26 of 2012).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These external organisations are not authorised by us to use your Personal Data for anything other than the
        purpose(s) for which we supplied that data to them or as required by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise required or permitted by law, we will only disclose your Personal Data with your consent
        (implied or expressed), and we will also take reasonable steps to ensure the external organisation to whom we
